# nat-type-identifier

## Overview

A JS-based Network Address Transalation (NAT) type identifier based on the PyStun implementation originally written by gaohawk (see: https://pypi.org/project/pystun/) which follows RFC 3489 https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3489.txt.

The return of execution will return the NAT type in use by the system running the program, the returned type will be one of the following:

```
- Blocked
- Open Internet
- Full Cone
- Symmetric UDP Firewall
- Restric NAT
- Restric Port NAT
- Symmetric NAT
```

## Features

To ensure the most reliable result, the program executes a number of tests which each determine the NAT type before a mode is selected from the list of results based on the most probable type. This is because issues might occur where occassional UDP packets fail to deliver.

## Usage

```
const getNatType = require("nat-type-identifier");

// Parameters default to following listed below
const params = { logsEnabled: true, sampleCount: 20, stunHost: "stun.sipgate.net" };

const whatsMyNat = async () => {
  const result = await getNatType(params);
  console.log("Result: ", result); // Outputs NAT type
  return result;
};

whatsMyNat();
```

## Installation

`npm install -g nat-type-identifier`
